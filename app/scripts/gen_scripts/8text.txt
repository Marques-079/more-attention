I am so, so tired of being the “responsible one.” I don’t know if anyone else knows what it’s like to stand there in your own hallway with a work ID still around your neck, your hands shaking, looking at a stack of boxes taller than you are—heavy, expensive, smug—knowing, just knowing, that your future is inside those boxes and it’s not yours anymore. Because that’s exactly what it felt like when I realized my boyfriend secretly used my college savings to buy himself a gaming PC. Not a computer for school. Not a laptop for us to share. Not a family emergency. A gaming PC. Gleaming, ridiculous, RGB-lit proof that I have been dating a man-child who thinks love means a direct line to my bank account.

Let me paint the picture, because, as usual, I know someone will ask, how could you not see this coming? Honestly, I did, and I didn’t. I’ve been working two jobs since March—office receptionist 8 to 4:30, then host at a restaurant Friday through Sunday. When you grow up the oldest daughter in a family that expects you to handle things (rides, forms, phone calls, the “hard conversations”), you learn to make things happen with duct tape and Google Calendar. I wanted something that was mine, genuinely mine: I got into a part-time bachelor’s completion program starting in the fall. Tuition isn’t astronomical, but it’s no joke either. Every paycheck, I scraped a little off, tucked it away into a separate high-yield account I opened with an online bank. I had $5,472.19 saved. Don’t laugh; for me, that was huge. That was me buying my way out of saying “maybe next year.”

Enter the boyfriend. We met through a mutual friend—he was funny, attentive, a little flashy in a way I’m embarrassed to admit I mistook for confidence. He told me he wanted to get serious about his music and maybe streaming “just for fun at first.” He was between jobs—“my old boss screwed me”—and I said okay, because I’ve been between jobs too. I thought it would be temporary. He moved in with me six months ago (I know, I know), insisted on paying what he could, and “what he could” turned out to be covering Uber Eats on Fridays and occasionally buying toilet paper. The rest—rent, electric, gas, parking, Wi-Fi—fell to me. He’d text me pictures of broken-lid Tupperware and say, “Babe, we need new kitchen stuff,” as if he was a contributor to the kitchen situation, like his name was on a single bill. I kept telling myself it would level out when he found something. I’m stupidly optimistic like that.

He knew I was going back to school. He knew exactly how much that meant to me. We didn’t fight about my savings; I told him upfront, it’s for tuition, books, gas, and maybe a used laptop if mine doesn’t last. I showed him my acceptance email. He literally hugged me and said, “This is your glow up.” Those actual words. Then he asked me, out of nowhere, about “how much I had saved so far,” and—this is where you can drag me—I told him the ballpark. I didn’t give him my login, I didn’t hand him my routing number, but I told him the range. Because he was my boyfriend, living under my roof, eating the food I buy and multiplying the laundry I do by three. I thought honesty would mean safety.

Three weeks ago, I noticed he was watching a ton of PC build videos. He started using phrases like “future-proofing” and “content rig” and “investment.” I told him, cool, save up for it. Put aside a little every week. Make a budget. He rolled his eyes and said, “You think I don’t know how to save?” (He didn’t. It has since become clear he didn’t.)

I get home last Wednesday, and there are boxes everywhere. Huge ones. Lian Li, Corsair, NVIDIA, labels that made me feel like I was in a tech store instead of my hallway. He’s on the floor with scissors, grinning. “Surprise!” he says.

My first thought wasn’t even the money. It was, “Where are we going to put this?” I live in a 1-bedroom. My second thought hit me like a punch: “How did he pay for this?” I dropped my bag, opened my bank app with that weird cold feeling spreading out from my chest. Savings: $32.64.

$32.64.

I felt sound leave the room. “Where’s my money.” It wasn’t a question. It came out flat, like the air itself decided to collapse. He laughed—laughed—and said, “Babe, don’t be dramatic. I moved it to your checking and then I used my card so it’s fine. It’s all ours anyway.”

I can’t describe the sound I made. Rage and panic at the same time. I clicked into the transactions. Transfers from savings to checking, and then, yep, charges: “MicroCenter,” “Amazon,” “Best Buy,” “Newegg.” I scrolled and scrolled. There were smaller ones too, earlier in the week. A “Steam gift card.” A “Razer chair.” A goddamn “Elgato key light.”

“You used my tuition.”

“No,” he says immediately, like he knows how to do this dance already. “No, no, no. It’s an investment in us. Once I get the stream going, we’ll make it back in a month. Two, tops. You can do student loans for the first semester, and then I’ll—”

“I told you. I told you that money was for school.” I’m on the floor now because my knees are nothing, and the boxes are just looming. The largest one, a curved monitor, smells like fresh plastic. I hate that I noticed the smell. He tries to touch my arm. I jerk away.

“Don’t be like this,” he says, and honestly, this phrase should come pre-packaged with a red flag warning. “You knew I needed a PC. My laptop is from 2015. Streaming from a PS5 is a joke. How am I supposed to get anywhere without the right tools? I’m doing this for our future.”

“Our future?” I point at the tower box. “What part of our future requires a $3,000 graphics card?”

His face goes sour. “If you’re going to be unsupportive—”

I think I started laughing then, the kind of weird, unhinged laugh that comes out when reality refuses to believe you. “You stole from me. You know that, right? This is theft.”

You know how, with some people, you can literally watch them try on different versions of events until one fits? First he was Mr. Confidence, then Mr. You’re Overreacting, and then his eyes got watery—like someone turned on a faucet—and he went into Mr. Hurt. “I can’t believe you’d call me a thief. I thought we were building a life together. You always say you want someone who believes in you. Why can’t you believe in me?”

I have believed in him. I believed when he said the job market was messed up and he’d find something soon. I believed when he wanted me to front the phone bill “just this month” because his unemployment was pending. I believed when he took my car and came back with a parking ticket—then a second—because “the signage was confusing.” I believed when he promised to replace the toaster he broke (he did not). I believed when he said now that he had time he’d take on more housework; he started two loads of laundry once and left them wet in the washing machine for three days. Every belief, a little IOU stacked on top of the last. The pile collapsed last Wednesday.

“I want you out,” I said. My voice surprised me. Calm. Full. Wildly calm. “Pack your stuff. You’re done.”

The whiplash on his face—shock to rage in 0.5 seconds. “You’d throw me out over a computer?” He gestured to the boxes like they’d suddenly bled innocence. “You’re so petty. This is why I need to make my own money, so you don’t hold it over me.”

I stood up, slowly, because if I moved fast I was going to throw something. “No. I’m throwing you out because you do not respect me. Because you think my goals are suggestions and yours are gospel. Because you lied. Because you stole. Because I told you where my safe place was and you broke into it.”

He swore he didn’t “break into anything,” and you know what, technically, in the worst possible way, he’s right. He used my phone. He literally used my face while I was asleep to unlock my banking app. Tell me that’s not worse—your face used like a crowbar.

“Also,” I said, because at this point my mouth was moving of its own accord, “the bank is closed now, but tomorrow, first thing, I’m locking everything down and reporting this. You can either help me box this crap back up so I can return it—”

“There are restocking fees,” he says, like he’s the one paying them.

“—or you can get the hell out and I will deal with it. Either way, you’re leaving.”

He folded his arms. He tried to stare me down. “You’re not packing my stuff.”

“Watch me.”

I think I would have faltered if I didn’t have a tiny chorus in the back of my head that sounded like every time I’ve had to be the adult when no one else would. I pulled our suitcase from under the bed (yes, ours; I bought it). I pulled out his dresser drawers and dumped them onto the bed. I had to stop in the middle to breathe. He kept sputtering—insults, guilt trips, making himself the victim so fast I got dizzy: “I guess I’ll just go be homeless while you sit on your high horse,” “Your parents will be ashamed,” “I thought you’d at least talk to me like a partner.” Meanwhile, the labels on the boxes—“GeForce RTX 4090”—glinted smugly every time I turned.

I didn’t sleep. I put his clothes in the suitcase, his shoes in a garbage bag (I was not about to fold his socks like I still loved him), his toiletries and his stupid beard oil in a tote. I unplugged the PS5 he bought on a Best Buy credit card with my name as the authorized user (oh, that’s a whole separate story), set it next to the door, and resisted the urge to frisbee it out the window. I took pictures of everything. I don’t even know why—maybe so I could prove to myself later that I had done it. Evidence that I followed through.

At 8:01 a.m., I was at the bank. I told them what happened. I felt like a cliche, on the verge of tears, trying to explain that my boyfriend used my face to open my bank app, transfer my money to checking, and buy himself a neon monument to his own ego. The teller widened her eyes; she went to get her manager. They froze my accounts, put a hold on the transactions they could, and told me to file a police report to support the fraud claim. “Domestic situations are tricky,” the manager said, and I know she meant well, but the way “domestic situations are tricky” has become the shorthand for “we might not do anything” made me want to scream. I did file the report. The officer who took it at the station nodded sympathetically and said, “Unfortunately, if he’s on the lease…” He isn’t. He is not on the lease. For once my “we’ll add you later” procrastination served me.

Back home, I called MicroCenter and Amazon and Newegg and every place whose name was on my phone. Amazon: I printed the labels and re-sealed the box with tape and fury. MicroCenter: “We can take returns within 30 days; bring the items unopened or pay a restocking fee.” That cursed phrase again. I ate the fee. It hurt less than watching those items sit in my living room while he played hero in his own story.

He came back around noon. He started in the hallway when he saw the suitcase by the door, “You can’t be serious,” and by the time he made it to the living room and saw me printing the last return label, he was panicking. “You can’t return that stuff. It’s mine.”

“No, it’s mine. My money paid for it.”

“Our money,” he snapped, and I swear, I felt something physically break in me, like a tension wire that shouldn’t have been stretched that far. He kept going: “You said you wanted us to act like a team, right? Teams use resources. It’s not my fault you’re cheap and scared.”

I didn’t slap him; I want credit for that. Instead, I picked up the phone and said, “I need an officer to come for a civil standby while my ex gets his belongings.” It’s a magic phrase, apparently. They sent someone. The cop stood in my doorway, a physical reminder to him that I meant it when I said I wanted him out. He played it up for the cop too—pretending to be confused and wounded, “She just flipped over a miscommunication,” as if he accidentally used my face to crack into my finances.

It took 40 minutes to get him out. He stood in the hallway, texting furiously. I would bet good money he was messaging his friends some version of, “She kicked me out over a misunderstanding” or “She’s always been controlling.” For the first time, I didn’t care what they thought. I changed the Wi-Fi password while he was still in the elevator. I had already changed my phone passcode, my bank login, every password attached to anything with even an email address. I froze my credit with all three bureaus, called the bank to confirm the report filed, and then sat on the floor and cried until hiccups.

That night, his mother called me. His mother. “How could you do this to my son?” she said, like I had betrayed him instead of the other way around. “He told me you refused to support his career. He said you embarrassed him in front of the police. He said you put your hands on him.” That last part made me laugh again, dangerously, the way a balloon laughs when it’s overfilled seconds before it bursts. “Do you want me to send you the screenshots, Carol?” I said. “Would you like me to forward the bank statements and the return labels and the police report number? Because I’m happy to do that.”

She spluttered. “He’s not a bad person,” she said. “He just needs encouragement.”

He needs consequences. He has never had them. That’s the difference.

My friends are split. My closest, the ones who’ve watched me pick him up from dudes’ nights because “he didn’t feel like walking,” the ones who helped me move my own dresser while he posted inspirational memes about “grinding”—they say they’re proud of me. A couple others said I was “dramatic” for getting the police involved and that “this is what happens in relationships sometimes.” I keep wanting to shake them through the phone: since when? Since when is using someone’s savings “what happens”? If I had been a man and my girlfriend used my tuition to buy a Louis Vuitton haul, would we call it a relationship thing or a felony thing?

He texted me the next day: “We need to talk.” I told him, “We’ve talked. I need my money back or I proceed with every legal avenue.” Then came the whiplash messages: “I’m sorry,” “You’re heartless,” “I miss you,” “I’m going to pay you back when the computer starts making money,” “You ruined my life,” “Can I at least come get my PS5,” “You never believed in me.” The PS5 belongs to the credit card with my name on it because when he applied, his credit wasn’t enough. I told him, “You can pick it up Saturday at 10 a.m. with a police standby.” He didn’t argue. He knows now—somehow he finally figured out—I’m done.

People always ask, why did you put up with it for so long? Because it creeps. It creeps and it flatters. It’s not like he walked in day one and said, “HI, I’m about to commit identity fraud with your face and buy a 4090.” He looked me in the eyes and said, “I love you. I’ve never had anyone take care of me like this,” as if I was blessed to be allowed to prove my worth by paying his parking tickets. He asked me to help with his resume. I did. He asked me to give him feedback on a music mix. I did, even though I would rather choke on a handful of silica packets than hear another half-finished song titled “Vibes” again. He told me I made him want to be better. He put his head on my lap and told me about his dad leaving and his first girlfriend cheating. And I am not made of stone; I wanted to be the safe place for him the way I never had a safe place myself. The difference is, when someone shows you that your softness is a faucet to them, to be turned on when needed and shut off whenever you get inconvenient, you either harden in time or drown. I was drowning and I didn’t know it until he bought himself a snorkel with my air.

I’m writing this because I need to say, to get out of my own echo chamber, that I am not crazy for calling this what it is. It’s not a “misunderstanding.” It’s not me being “cheap.” It’s not “he just wanted to invest in himself.” The only reason he was able to convince himself it was okay is because he believes—and has probably always believed—that women are supposed to subsidize men’s dreams. He dressed it up in “our future,” but what he really meant was “my convenience.”

Also, in case anyone wants to know about consequences, yes, the bank actually came through on some of it. Because of the biometric issue, they flagged it as a gray area, but once I filed the police report, they credited back the online charges that I could prove were not authorized by me at the time (timestamps helped). The MicroCenter stuff, which he physically paid for with my transferred funds, is messier. I’m still out the restocking fee and some of the peripheral costs. The emergency grant office at my school listened, took notes, and told me they have hardship funds specifically for students who have been the victim of financial abuse—he didn’t hit me, but he hurt me on purpose in a way that’s harder to show in pictures. They’re covering half my first semester. My aunt Venmoed me $500 with a note that said, “For your books. I wish your grandmother were here. She’d be proud.” I cried again, obviously.

And by the way, in case anyone wants to romanticize this with the “starving artist who just needs a shot” narrative, I found the notebook where he wrote out “streaming ideas.” There were three. “Fortnite but funny.” “React vids to fails.” “IRL stream at the mall.” EPIC. VISIONARY. WORTH RUINING SOMEONE’S EDUCATION FOR. You can’t see me, but my eyebrows have left my face, moved into a new apartment, started fresh without me.

I have wanted to post this here for days, but every time I started, I felt like I was on trial again. Like I had to lay out my receipts in a grid and ask permission to be furious. I’m done with that. He did a selfish, scary thing, and I did the necessary, unglamorous, grown-up thing. I packed his bags. I dealt with the bank. I swallowed the humiliation of telling a stranger at a customer service desk, “My boyfriend used my face to commit fraud.” I picked up extra shifts. I asked for help without bleeding out from the pride wound. I bought a cheap lockbox for my important documents and bolted it into the closet shelf. I changed the passcode on my phone to something even I have to re-type twice. I reminded myself that “love” should never be a euphemism for “exposure to harm.”

He keeps posting vague statuses on Instagram: “Betrayed by the one I thought was my forever,” paired with a black screen and a broken heart emoji. It’s surreal that we live on the same planet. People I barely know have DM’d me like, “OMG did you really kick him out over a computer?” My answer, in case you were wondering, is: I kicked him out because he didn’t care if I ever finished school as long as he got to hear his mechanical keyboard click while strangers in chat called him “king.” He wanted me to co-sign my own erasure. He thought I would flinch and take it. It turns out I will flinch and still do the right thing.

I took the last of the boxes to UPS yesterday. There was a moment, standing behind a guy shipping a bike tire and some lady returning a pile of holiday sweaters, where I looked at the tower box and felt like I was mailing away a version of myself. The version that waited. The version that said, “Maybe if I just show him how much I believe in him, he will meet me halfway.” Do you know how heavy a computer case is? Heavy enough to convince you your arms will fall off. Lighter than resentment.

When I came home, the apartment was so quiet I could hear the fridge hum. No twitchy clicking of controllers. No fake sighs. No ever-present smell of instant ramen. I washed the sheets. I opened the windows. I sat down with my class list and highlighted every due date in neon. It felt like rebellion. It felt like relief. It felt like I was finally, finally in a room with only my future and me.

For anyone reading this who wonders if you’re overreacting, who hears that little voice that says, “Maybe I’m being too strict with my boundaries,” please hear me: they listen when you say that. The takers listen. They lean in. They push. Boundaries aren’t mean. They’re the doors on your house. You are allowed to close them. You are allowed to lock them. You are allowed to throw out a person who keeps using your keys to steal from your pantry and then calls you “a bad host.”

I don’t know what he’ll do next. I suspect he’ll land on another couch with another girl who makes a mean spaghetti and believes in potential; I hope she gets out faster than I did, and I hope he gets therapy that doesn’t become a weapon he uses to justify his entitlement. I have enough on my plate: work, school, sleep, remembering that I am worth more than being “supportive” at my own expense.

Yesterday, I walked past a gaming store and actually felt a laugh bubble up—like, a real laugh, not the broken balloon kind. In the window, a rig glowed like a nightclub VIP room. I imagined him standing there, seeing a future framed in LED, and for a second, I almost understood it. Then I kept walking. I have a different glow up, and it doesn’t come in a box. It comes in breaths I can take, and nights I can sleep, and a credit score that belongs only to me, and the knowledge that when everything was on the line, I chose myself. I packed his bags. And I’d do it again.
