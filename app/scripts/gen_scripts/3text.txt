ProRevenge: My Roommate Tried To Ruin My Life, So I Planned A Payback She’ll Never Forget.

I know how this is going to sound. You’re going to think, “Okay, this girl is dramatic,” or “Something’s missing.” But I’m exhausted. I am the overworked, designated fixer in everyone’s life—eldest daughter, default caregiver, the person who notices the trash bag is full before it bursts and takes it out, every time. I work full time, pick up a part-time gig on weekends, and I help my mom (chemo, rides, grocery runs—things her other children promise they’ll do and then forget… somehow). The only reason I even had a roommate was because my partner—let’s call him Matt—liked the “flexibility” of not living together yet. Flexibility apparently meant me juggling bills, smiling through his late cancellations, and covering gaps without a complaint. Rent jumped; I found a roommate; and I told myself it would be fine.

Enter Sasha. (Names changed because I’d rather not have to explain to HR why my personal life has an audit trail on Reddit.)

Sasha was a friend-of-a-friend—our mutual swore she was “easygoing” and “clean.” She toured the apartment with this wide-eyed wonder, said things like, “This is so cozy!” and “We can do wine nights!” She made a show of taking her shoes off at the door and nodding at my little houseplants like they were sacred relics. She had the right job (remote social media manager), the right budget, and a vague back story about needing a place “while she figured things out.” I said yes.

Week one: she “borrowed” my olive oil. I shrugged. Week two: my mug—the one I got from my mom after her second biopsy, the one that says “Nevertheless, she persisted”—disappeared. I found it under her bed, filled with the remains of a protein shake. “Oh my gosh, I am so sorry,” she said, a hand flutter to the chest like a fainting Victorian. She giggled. “I’m such a Leo.” Week three: I came home after a ten-hour shift and found three of her friends in our living room, filming a TikTok with my throw blanket as a prop and my candle burning. “Babe,” she said over the thump-thump of whatever trending audio was playing. “We are doing a collab. It’s exposure—for all of us.”

Exposure… for what? My candle?

I tried to set a boundary, calmly, because I live in the real world and I know people make mistakes. We sat at the kitchen table; I had a short list on my phone, easy breezy, bullet points so I wouldn’t ramble:
One. Please ask before borrowing personal items.
Two.  No filming strangers (me) without consent.
Three. Overnight guests—heads up appreciated.
And lastly Shared spaces cleaned after use.

Sasha nodded, thumbed her phone like she was taking notes, and said, “Totally. I’m like… super respectful.”

The late rent started on month two. “Can I be like… a teeny bit late?” she texted, a glittery heart emoji punctuating the ask like sugar on a rotten tooth. “My client’s payment hit weird.” That “teeny bit” turned into eight days and a sob story about a broken laptop (which I later discovered in perfect working order on her Instagram story). I covered it because the landlord doesn’t accept vibes as currency. Then—and this is where the manipulation Olympics started—I woke up to an email from the landlord about “multiple complaints” of loud music and “excessive guests.”

Let me be crystal clear: I work. I come home. I eat a thing. I text my partner a meme he doesn’t respond to. I sleep. The “excessive guests” were her friends. The “loud music” was her playlist. When I brought it up, she went full doe-eyed. “Oh… I didn’t realize we had… neighbors like… that.” Like what, exactly? People who don’t want their walls shaking at 12:43 a.m.?

I started documenting. Not because I’m petty (although, sure, petty can be delicious), but because I know how these things go. I learned that lesson the hard way from family—if you can’t show it, it didn’t happen. Dates. Times. Photos of sinkfuls of dishes with timestamps. Texts saved. Receipts for the rent I covered with highlighted dates. I got a small notebook. My therapist calls it creating a paper trail; my mother calls it “proof, because if you’re not squeaky clean, they will dirty you up.”

Then the sabotage escalated in ways that were almost… artful. She started texting my friends under the guise of “checking in” when I was late to group dinners because I was literally wheeling my mother from radiation to radiology. She said things like, “Is she okay? I worry about her when she gets like this” and “She’s been so… tense lately.” She told Matt I was “snappy” and “going through something,” which—fine, yes, I was. His response? “Hey, maybe you should chill.” He parroted her language back to me, and I swear I could hear her little voice behind his text bubble, telling him how to soothe me.

Then someone called my HR. Anonymous. “Just wanted to make sure you’re aware… your employee frequently violates confidentiality from her home office.” I didn’t violate anything. I work at my desk; I have a privacy screen; I lock my files like a squirrel hoarding acorns. But HR is HR, and they have a protocol. They talked to me. They asked for a description of my home setup. They required a walkthrough via Zoom where I had to point my camera at my workspace to prove it met policy. It was humiliating, in that quiet, drippy way where you smile and pretend it’s fine while something acidic chews your insides.

Sasha watched me scramble, and she watched me reassure my manager, and then she stood in the kitchen and said, “Wow, corporate is like, intense.” She was stirring my almond butter with a knife—the audacity. “It must be super stressful to have them not trust you.”

I stared at the trail of oily smears she left on the counter. “It is,” I said, and I did not cry, not even a little. “Especially when I haven’t done anything wrong.”

At that point, if I’d had a partner with a functional spine, he would have been here, seeing the things I saw—her leaving the oven on, the shattered plate tossed behind my recycling bin like a forensic clue, the plants moved “for better lighting” so she could film—and he would have said, “No. Absolutely not.” Instead, I had Matt, whose contribution was “Try not to let her get to you.”

Then came the mail. A neighbor put an envelope in our door crack while I was at work. “Found this opened in the trash.” It was a late notice for a medical bill. It had my name on it. The seal was sliced—not ripped, sliced—like it had been opened with a letter opener. When I held it up to Sasha, her eyes flicked to the corner where the glue frays when it’s opened with heat (yes, I noticed, because I notice everything, because I can never stop noticing). “That’s… wild,” she said. “People are such creeps.”

I filed it all. I called the post office and logged an official complaint. I told the landlord I believed there was a safety issue. I moved what mattered behind my locked bedroom door and changed my passwords. Then—as if the Universe demanded an offering—Sasha finally handed me a gift-wrapped red flag big enough to use as a parachute: she applied for a remote contract with my company. How do I know? Because she asked me to be a reference. My jaw actually clicked when it dropped.

“I mean, you know how like, flexible they are,” she said, bouncing on the balls of her feet, eyes bright. “And I just told them you had no problem with me streaming from the living room while you’re working in your room. That we’re like… so good at sharing space.”

That’s when I realized, fully, what she was doing. It wasn’t just thoughtlessness; it was deliberate. She wanted my life—my job’s flexibility, my apartment’s location, my friend circle—and where she couldn’t fit, she wanted to wedge me out. She had called HR not to get me fired, but to preemptively poison the well: If she got the contract, she’d slide in like a rescuing angel after I “self-sabotaged.” That was the shape of it, and once I saw it, I couldn’t unsee it.

So I made a plan. Not a messy plan. Not a “throw her clothes out the window and change the locks” plan. I made a plan that tasted like the moment after you finally floss: a little blood, a lot of relief.

Step one: I stopped covering for her. It sounds simple, but when you’ve been trained to be the duct tape on everyone else’s disasters, it’s radical. Rent? Due on the first, late on the fifth, fee on the sixth. I made sure the landlord had separate checks, hers and mine. The third week of the month, he hadn’t received hers. “She told me she sent it,” I said. He sighed. “She didn’t.” I forwarded him screen shots of my texts where I reminded her of deadlines—politely, because I am always polite. That got me on his good side, which mattered later.

Step two: I told my manager privately what was happening at home. Not the dramatics—just the facts. The late-night filming. The unapproved guests. The HR call. The roommate wanting to apply for a contract with our company. I dropped in my documentation like breadcrumbs—dates, times, photos. “I’m on top of my work,” I reassured, because I am. “And I’m addressing the living situation through proper channels.” She thanked me for the transparency and, in a voice that warmed the frostbite in my chest, said, “We’ll make sure any hiring decisions around your home address are handled by someone without knowledge of your household.” Translation: Sasha would not be sliding in through a crack.

Step three: I used the lease. I know, in Reddit stories, people fantasize about scorched Earth. But the lease is a boring, beautiful weapon if you wield it with patience. Our lease prohibited “running a business”—which covered her content house parties—“excessive noise,” and “tampering with mail.” It also allowed for mid-term roommate removal with cause, if the primary tenant (me) documented violations and gave proper notice. I built my file. I emailed management weekly—not whining, just annotating. “On 4/19, at 12:43 a.m., Sasha hosted five guests; I have Ring camera footage of front door entries (building installed, not me), which I can share if needed. On 4/22, loud music heard by two neighbors; see attached neighbor emails. On 4/25, third late rent this quarter; see ledger.”

Meanwhile, Sasha kept tightening the noose she thought she was looping around me. She posted a story from our living room of her “office” with the caption “Work/life balance is a myth lol,” tagging my company. She threw a “brand collab brunch” with no notice—six girls, mimosas, avocado skins smeared into the trash like modern art. She left an empty La Croix can on the bookshelf next to my framed picture of my mom with her chemo scarf tied like a crown.

I did not scream. I did not cry. I did, however, have three conversations:
- With my neighbor, Mary, who had already complained. I thanked her for her patience, apologized for the disturbances, and asked her if she’d be willing to write down any further incidents for the landlord.
- With my mutual friend—the one who introduced us—where I said, calmly, “Sasha is not working out. Going forward, please don’t use me as a landing pad for your chaotic friends.”
- With Matt. I said, “I need you to believe me.” He said, “I do.” He did not show up, but the words mattered in a small, sad way.

Then the chess move: an inspection. Building management does yearly checks, but they can do immediate ones if there are repeated violations. I requested one. They scheduled for a Friday at 10 a.m.—Sasha’s golden hour for filming. She whined. “I have… deliverables.” I smiled, not sorry. “Then move them.”

On that Friday, the manager and an assistant walked in with clipboards and measured nothing, because this wasn’t about dimensions; it was about seeing. They saw my clean kitchen; they saw her ring light permanently set up in the living room; they saw four pairs of shoes under the couch, none mine; they saw the burn mark on the counter from her curling iron; they saw the pile of mail on the console with my name, some opened. When they asked, mildly, “Do you often host guests?” she laughed. “We’re like… community-oriented.” When they asked about the mail, she said, “Our mailboxes get stuck; I help her.” I did not say a word—I just opened my folder and slid across my written complaint to the post office, their response, and the fact I’d installed a temporary mail hold to my own name.

They left, silent in that heavy way bureaucrats are silent when their job is to write something down and make you wait.

I expected her to explode. Instead, she imploded. She turned into sweet syrup—texted me “Hey, can we like… hit reset?” and bought a bag of ethical coffee beans she thought I liked. She posted a note on the fridge with a cleaning schedule. She put a succulent on the windowsill and said, “It’s our plant,” like we were a couple and not a hostage situation.

She also—oh, bless her—sent a pitch to my company using a Gmail account with her full name, with screenshots that included our living room, my throw pillows, and a half-visible letter addressed to me on the coffee table. HR forwarded it to my manager. My manager forwarded it to me with the note: “Just so you’re aware.” I added it to my pile.

Then the letter came. Management found cause. They issued a notice to cure or quit—basically, “Fix your behavior or leave.” It was addressed to both of us, but the bullet points were… poetry:
Cease use of premises for business-related filming without prior written approval. Abide by quiet hours; failure to do so will result in penalties outlined in lease §7. No tampering with mail; any report or documentation of such behavior will be grounds for immediate termination of rental agreement.
Guests must be limited as stipulated in lease §9; continued violations will be considered cause.

The cure date was two weeks from delivery. Two weeks of silence. Two weeks where her friends didn’t come over and the ring light vanished and the sink sparkled and she cleaned up grease splatters like her life depended on it. And then, true to form, the last weekend before the deadline, she cracked. She threw a “tiny dinner” that included laughter so sharp it cut through my noise-canceling headphones. At 1:15 a.m., something shattered. At 1:18, my neighbor texted me, “I’m calling management.”

I slept like a baby.

Then came the last piece of the payback—a piece I didn’t even realize I wanted until it slid into place: money. You know how people say, “It’s not about the money”? It wasn’t, until it was. Sasha had cost me time, peace, and late fees. So I filed in small claims for the back rent I covered (I had receipts), the late fees (I had dates), and the cost of replacing my ruined mug and the scorched counter (I had photos, estimates). I filed properly, in daylight, with my documents and my stapler and my aching, righteous little heart.

Her response was… wild. She filed a counterclaim for “emotional distress,” said I had “created a hostile environment,” and included screenshots of texts she sent herself from a number with no contact name saying things like, “You’re not welcome here.” The judge—bless him—asked her if she had any proof those texts were sent by me. She did not. He asked why the timestamps overlapped with times I was clocked in on my workplace Zoom account; she blushed and said, “I don’t… know about that.” He asked why she’d been on my couch during business hours for our company while claiming she had her own clients; she said, “We collaborate.” When he asked who “we” was, she floundered.

I won. Judgment in my favor for the exact amount I’d asked for, plus filing fees. The garnishment came later, slowly, like honey dripping back into my jar one wage at a time.

The day she moved out, she did it like a ghost in reverse: loud, obvious, messy. She slammed cabinets. She left the fridge open. She dragged a suitcase down the stairs and scuffed the walls. She stood in the doorway, ring light under her arm like a beacon for bad decisions, and said, “You know, you didn’t have to make it this hard.”

I looked at her, and I saw the entire year in a flat plane: my mother’s sleeping breaths after chemo, the humiliation of panning my camera around my tiny apartment for HR, the late-night scrubbing of pans I didn’t dirty, the texts from the man who was supposed to lift me up telling me to “chill,” the neighbor’s sigh, the envelope with my name on it sliced open, my plants moved so her face could have better mid-morning light. My rage was tidy. It fit in my pocket like a smooth stone. I didn’t have to hurl it to hit her. I just said, “You tried to ruin my life to make space for yours. I just cleaned up.”

She scoffed. She left.

The payback she’ll never forget isn’t the judgment—she’ll forget it when it’s paid. It’s not even the eviction notice with her name on it, tucked into her file in the landlord’s office. It’s what happened after: I wrote her a reference letter, the truth kind, the kind people don’t know how to read until they learn. “Sasha is creative and enjoys community,” I wrote. “In shared environments, she requires clear guidelines to maintain professional boundaries.” I posted a neutral, factual review on the roommate app we’d used: “Quiet hours were a challenge; rent often late; work boundaries blurry. Document everything.”

Every time she applies for a new lease and a landlord searches her name and sees those words, she will remember me—not with rage, but with the dull annoyance of consequences. The way a burn stings when you wash your hands in hot water months later.

And before you ask, yes, Matt and I are no longer together. He said, “You seem angrier lately.” I said, “I got tired of biting my tongue while other people chew on my life.” He blinked. He told me I should “work on my reactions.” I told him to go work on actually showing up. Loved ones warned me I’d regret it—who wants to be alone in this economy? Me. I want to be alone rather than sharing my shower with someone else’s extensions while they text my boss about my alleged policy violations.

There are people who will read this and think I went too far. That “payback” is petty, that I should have “let it go,” that being vindicated is a bad look. I’m here to tell you: If you’re the one always giving the benefit of the doubt while your sanity is starved, vindication is a meal. I collected mine with receipts, with polite emails, with the calm of someone who has been told she’s overreacting since she could form a boundary.

The apartment feels different now. I can hear my own music. My mugs are all accounted for. The ring light echoes are gone. My mom’s scarf is still next to my photo, and sometimes I look at it and think of how she smiled when she handed me that mug and said, “It’ll be okay.” It wasn’t okay for a while. Then I made it okay.

To anyone in the thick of it: document. Don’t yell—write. Don’t threaten—file. Use the boring tools. Respect your own labor so much that you refuse to let it be the quiet wallpaper for other people’s chaos. And when the moment comes, when you finally pull the thread that’s been holding your situation together for everyone but you—don’t apologize when it unravels. Let it.

Because here’s the thing no one tells you: People like Sasha count on you being too tired to follow through. They build their lives on your exhaustion, your politeness, your fear of being called “difficult.” They count on you to care more about harmony than they do about honesty. They count on silence. Break it.

I did. And somewhere out there, a girl who once thought she could eat off my plate and gaslight me about being hungry, now budgets around a garnishment and Googles “quiet hours” before she throws a party. She won’t forget me—not because I screamed, but because I signed my name on the dotted line where it mattered and the world, for once, backed me up.

Oh, and the olive oil? I bought the expensive bottle, finally. It tastes like victory—peppery, a little bitter, very, very real.
