My name is Jake and if I had any doubts
0:02
about where I stood in my family they
0:04
were erased the day I found out about
0:06
the will it wasn't even some dramatic
0:08
sit down moment where my parents dropped
0:10
the news themselves no I found out
0:13
entirely by accident by sheer Dum loock
0:16
it happened a few months ago when I was
0:17
at their house the same house I had been
0:19
helping them pay for over the past 5
0:21
years the mortgage the occasional
0:23
grocery runs even fixing up things
0:25
around the place I was the one keeping
0:27
it all together while my brother Eric
0:30
did absolutely nothing and when I say
0:32
nothing I mean nothing no job no
0:35
responsibilities just lounging around
0:37
waiting for life to hand him everything
0:39
on a silver platter which apparently my
0:42
parents were all too happy to provide
0:44
that day I was helping my dad with some
0:46
paperwork because as usual neither of
0:49
them could be bothered to figure out how
0:50
to do things themselves he had asked me
0:52
to skin some documents for him a bunch
0:55
of legal and financial stuff and I
0:57
didn't think twice about it until I saw
0:59
it a folder labeled a state plan and
1:02
last will and testament sitting right
1:03
there in the stack now I don't normally
1:06
Snoop but curiosity got the best of me
1:09
after all I had been the one making sure
1:11
they kept a roof over their heads it
1:13
wasn't exactly out of line to wonder how
1:15
things were set up for the future so I
1:17
opened it and that's when I saw the
1:19
words that made my stomach drop
1:21
everything and I mean everything was
1:23
going to Eric the house their savings
1:26
their assets not a single mention of me
1:28
except for some generic lines about
1:30
loving both of their sons equally yeah
1:33
sure equally that's why they made sure
1:35
their Golden Child would inherit
1:37
everything while the sun actually
1:38
keeping them afloat didn't even get a
1:40
footnote I felt like a fool here I was
1:43
bending over backward for them making
1:45
sure their bills got paid on time making
1:47
sure they never had to worry about food
1:50
while they sat back and planned for a
1:52
future where I got absolutely nothing
1:54
and Eric he wasn't just lazy he was
1:56
entitled he never lifted a finger to
1:58
help them never contributed a dime but
2:01
he had somehow convinced them that he
2:02
deserved it all maybe because he was the
2:05
younger son maybe because they just
2:07
always baby him maybe because he knew
2:09
exactly how to manipulate them whatever
2:11
the reason they had made their choice I
2:13
sat there staring at the paper my hand
2:15
shaking from a mix of rage and betrayal
2:18
how long had they planned this had they
2:20
always intended for me to just be their
2:21
free financial safety net with nothing
2:23
in return did they ever even appreciate
2:25
what I did for them I had no idea how
2:28
long I had been sitting there but
2:29
eventually my dad noticed I wasn't
2:31
scanning anything Hey Jake what's taking
2:34
so long he asked walking back into the
2:37
room I didn't even bother to hide the
2:39
will I held it up and looked him dead in
2:41
the eye so this is how it is I said my
2:45
voice unnervingly calm everything to
2:47
Eric after everything I've done for you
2:49
my dad's face went pale for a second but
2:52
then he sighed like I was some little
2:54
kid throwing a tantrum Jake it's not
2:56
what you think really I snapped because
2:59
it looks pretty damn clear to me I've
3:01
been paying your mortgage helping with
3:03
groceries fixing the house up while Eric
3:05
does nothing and you still decided he's
3:07
the only one who matters dad looked
3:10
uncomfortable but instead of actually
3:12
explaining himself he just muttered it's
3:14
complicated that was it no apology no
3:18
attempt to justify it Beyond those two
3:19
useless words just a weak excuse and an
3:22
expectant look like he was waiting for
3:24
me to drop it and go back to being their
3:26
personal ATM I should have walked out
3:28
right then and there but I wanted to
3:30
hear it from both of them so I called
3:32
out for my mom when she came in and saw
3:35
the will in my hands her reaction wasn't
3:37
much better she at least had the decency
3:39
to look guilty but the words that came
3:41
out of her mouth made my blood boil Jake
3:44
honey you don't need the inheritance she
3:46
said gently like she was doing me a
3:48
favor you have a good job you're
3:50
independent Eric well he struggles we
3:54
just want to make sure he's taken care
3:55
of that was the moment something inside
3:57
me snapped they weren't even in it they
4:00
knew exactly what they were doing and in
4:02
their minds it was completely Justified
4:05
they had spent years enabling Eric's
4:06
laziness and now they were planning to
4:08
reward it by handing him everything
4:10
while I got tossed aside like an
4:12
afterthought I took a deep breath
4:14
clenched my jaw and set the wall down on
4:16
the table got it I said my voice eerily
4:19
calm glad to know where we stand then I
4:22
turned and walked out of the house
4:24
ignoring their protest as I slammed the
4:25
door behind me they had made their
4:27
decision now it was time for me to make
4:29
make mine I didn't go back to their
4:31
house after that I didn't call I didn't
4:34
check in for the first time in years I
4:36
let them handle their own damn problems
4:39
if they needed something fixed they
4:40
could figure it out if they needed
4:42
groceries they could find their own way
4:44
to the store and most importantly if
4:47
that mortgage Bill showed up well I
4:49
wasn't the one paying it anymore the
4:51
silence lasted about 2 weeks at first I
4:55
think they assumed I was just pouting
4:56
and would come crawling back like always
4:59
maybe they expected me to cool off and
5:01
apologize for daring to question their
5:03
decision but when the days kept passing
5:05
with no word from me and more
5:07
importantly no financial help you could
5:09
practically feel the shift in their
5:10
attitude then one afternoon my phone
5:13
bust dad texted the property taxes are
5:16
due that was it no he didn't text hey
5:20
how have you been no sorry for what
5:22
happened no we really appreciate
5:24
everything you've done just a cold
5:27
transactional message as if I were still
5:29
the walking bed they could tap into
5:30
whenever they pleased I stared at the
5:32
screen for a moment almost amused at how
5:35
predictable they were they really
5:36
thought they could just demand money
5:38
like nothing had happened that I'd keep
5:40
playing my part as their financial
5:41
safety net even after they made it clear
5:44
I was disposable I cly typed back I'm
5:47
sure Eric will handle it since the house
5:49
is his and all it took exactly 5 minutes
5:51
before my mom called I let it ring then
5:54
another text came through mom texted
5:57
Jake please don't be like this we need
5:59
need to talk oh now they wanted to talk
6:02
now that their bills were piling up and
6:04
reality was finally slapping them in the
6:06
face I waited an hour before replying
6:08
there's nothing to talk about you made
6:10
your choice now you can live with it I
6:13
figured that would be the end of it for
6:14
the day I had made my stance crystal
6:16
clear and there wasn't a single part of
6:18
me that felt guilty about it but then
6:21
Eric decided to chime in his text came
6:23
in late that evening in the second I saw
6:25
his name pop up on my phone I knew it
6:28
was going to be something obnoxious sure
6:30
enough when I opened it I was greeted
6:32
with pure entitlement Eric texted dude
6:35
why are you being such a drama queen
6:37
it's not a big deal just help them out
6:39
like you always do I nearly laughed not
6:42
a big deal he was really acting like I
6:44
had no right to be mad about this I
6:47
typed back no I think you've got it
6:49
covered since you're the favorite in all
6:51
Eric texted oh my God are you seriously
6:54
mad about the will grow up man it's just
6:57
money oh now it was just money now that
7:01
it was his to inherit it suddenly didn't
7:03
matter that hypocrisy was astounding I
7:05
shot back then you won't mind using some
7:08
of that money to pay for the mortgage
7:10
right silence a few minutes later my mom
7:13
texted me again this time going full
7:15
guilt trip mode mom texted Jake we your
7:18
parents family takes care of each other
7:21
we did so much for you growing up and
7:23
now you're just abandoning us I had to
7:25
take a deep breath to stop myself from
7:27
throwing my phone across the room aband
7:29
abandoning them I had spent years making
7:31
sure they never had to struggle all
7:33
while they coddled Eric and rewarded his
7:35
laziness and now that they finally had
7:37
to deal with the consequences of their
7:39
own decisions I was the bad guy I wasn't
7:41
falling for it not this time I responded
7:45
you made it clear I wasn't part of the
7:47
family when you left me out of the will
7:49
now Eric can take care of you I could
7:51
imagine my mom gasping dramatically at
7:53
that she always had a flare for acting
7:55
like the victim even when she was the
7:57
one in the wrong a few minutes later my
7:59
dad sent another text and this one had
8:01
me seething dad texted we're not asking
8:04
for much just enough to cover the
8:06
mortgage for a few more months until we
8:08
figure things out don't be selfish
8:11
selfish the word made my blood boil I
8:14
had been bailing them out for years
8:16
sacrificing my own money time and energy
8:19
to make their lives easier I had done
8:21
everything a good son was supposed to do
8:23
and how did they repay me by making sure
8:25
I got nothing in return and now when I
8:28
was finally standing up for myself I was
8:30
the selfish one I clenched my jaw took a
8:33
deep breath and typed back no I'm done
8:36
then I turned off my phone they had made
8:39
their choice now they were going to live
8:41
with it the silence lasted a day I knew
8:44
my parents wouldn't give up that easily
8:46
but I wasn't expecting what happened
8:47
next the next morning I woke up to a
8:50
notification on my phone a bank transfer
8:52
request I frowned unlocking my phone to
8:55
check it was from my mom she had
8:57
actually sent me a request for money
8:59
like I was some ATM the amount
9:03
$3,500 I stared at it in disbelief half
9:06
laughing at the audacity no message no
9:09
explanation just a cold Shameless demand
9:12
for the exact amount they needed to
9:13
cover their overdue mortgage they
9:15
weren't even asking anymore they were
9:17
just assuming I'd cave I declined it
9:19
without hesitation not even 5 minutes
9:22
later my phone rang it was Mom I let it
9:25
ring then came another text mom texted
9:28
Jake I know you saw the request why did
9:31
you decline it I took my time before
9:33
replying because it's not my
9:35
responsibility try Eric another call
9:38
declined then another text mom texted we
9:41
going to lose the house if you don't
9:43
help us oh now it was an emergency after
9:46
all those years of treating me like a
9:48
walking wallet now they were finally
9:50
facing the consequences I typed back
9:52
maybe you should have thought about that
9:54
before deciding I didn't matter a few
9:56
seconds later dad chimed in dad you're
9:59
really going to let your parents become
10:01
homeless W that one actually made me
10:04
laugh out loud the manipulation was so
10:06
blatant it was almost funny they weren't
10:08
broke they weren't about to be thrown on
10:11
the streets they just didn't want to dip
10:13
into their own savings because they were
10:14
so used to me covering everything I
10:17
ignored them for the rest of the day
10:18
that night I got a text from Eric dude
10:21
just send them the money already you're
10:23
making this a bigger deal than it is I
10:25
clenched my jaw this entitled little
10:27
prick really thought he could lecture me
10:29
I typed back you mean the same money
10:31
you're inheriting why don't you send it
10:34
his response came fast Eric texted you
10:37
know I don't have that kind of cash
10:38
right now oh so now it was about
10:41
affordability he was perfectly fine with
10:43
me draining my accounts but the second
10:45
it was his turn suddenly he had nothing
10:47
to offer I replied guess you better
10:50
figure it out then bro you're the one
10:52
they chose no response I went to bed
10:55
feeling oddly at peace like I had
10:57
finally broken free from years of
10:59
ipulation but the next day things
11:01
escalated I was at work when I got a
11:03
call from my apartment's front desk Hey
11:06
Jake uh your parents are here I nearly
11:09
dropped my phone what she hesitated
11:12
before adding they're saying it's an
11:14
emergency and that you won't answer
11:15
their calls oh my God they showed up at
11:19
my apartment just because I stopped
11:21
paying their bills I took a deep breath
11:23
pinching the bridge of my nose please
11:25
don't let them up I'm not expecting them
11:28
there was an awkward pause
11:30
uh they're being kind of pushy I
11:32
clenched my jaw I don't care they can
11:34
leave I hung up and immediately got a
11:37
text from Mom we downstairs open the
11:40
door no question no explanation just
11:43
another demand I didn't reply another
11:46
text from Mom Jake we're not leaving
11:48
until you talk to us I exhaled sharply
11:51
standing up from my desk they weren't
11:53
going to back down fine I was about to
11:56
teach them a lesson they wouldn't forget
11:58
I grabbed my keys and storm downstairs
12:00
my blood boiling I wasn't scared I was
12:03
Furious the sheer audacity of these
12:05
people to show up at my home Uninvited
12:08
demanding money like I was their
12:09
personal ATM not even a phone call First
12:12
not even a half-hearted apology just a
12:15
fullon Ambush they really thought they
12:17
could just Corner me into submission
12:18
like I was some naive kid I yanked the
12:21
door open and there they were mom dad
12:24
and of course Eric all standing in a
12:26
tight little formation like they were
12:28
about to Stage a family intervention mom
12:30
had her arms crossed her classic
12:32
disappointed mother looked locked and
12:34
loaded dad was standing stiff hands in
12:36
his pockets his expression a mix of
12:38
frustration and entitlement like he
12:41
couldn't believe I was actually making
12:42
him do this in person and Eric the
12:45
little leech had the nerve to look bored
12:47
like this whole situation was just
12:49
mildly inconvenient for him like he
12:51
wasn't the reason any of this was
12:52
happening the moment Mom saw me she went
12:55
full theatrics Jake finally we need to
12:58
talk I leaned against the door frame
13:00
arms crossed no you need to leave she
13:04
blinked as if she physically couldn't
13:06
comprehend what I just said excuse me
13:08
you heard me my voice was calm
13:11
controlled but firm you don't get to
13:13
just show up at my apartment demanding
13:14
money that's insane dad let out a sharp
13:17
scoff are you really going to let us
13:19
lose the house over a petty Grudge IUN
13:21
let out a cold laugh Petty Grudge Oh you
13:25
mean the one where you decided I was
13:26
good enough to pay your bills but not
13:28
good enough to be in your will that
13:29
Grudge mom gasped clutching her chest
13:32
like I had just slapped her Jake that's
13:34
not fair we only did what we thought was
13:36
best for the family I tilted my head
13:39
best for the family you mean best for
13:41
Eric just say it silence along heavy
13:45
silence Eric who had been weirdly quiet
13:48
up until now finally spoke up look man I
13:52
don't even want to be involved in this I
13:54
didn't ask for anything I turned to him
13:56
finally letting loose no you just sit
13:59
back and take everything that's handed
14:01
to you you're 28 years old Eric get a
14:04
damn job his face turned red dude what
14:07

14:13
acting like a homeowner you want to be
14:14
the golden child start paying their damn
14:17
bills I'm done being your personal bank
14:20
Eric looked away suddenly very
14:21
interested in the pavement mom took a
14:24
deep breath recalibrating her guilt trip
14:27
Jake he's your brother I nodded
14:29
yep and I've supported him longer than
14:31
you ever have Dad's face darkened you're
14:34
being selfish I laughed a real genuine
14:37
laugh oh that's rich coming from you I
14:40
gestured between them you two decided
14:42
that Eric deserved everything and I
14:44
deserved nothing and now that it's time
14:46
to pay the price for that choice you're
14:48
trying to manipulate me into fixing it
14:50
for you not happening mom's voice
14:53
sharpened we thought you'd be mature
14:55
about this I raised an eyebrow mature
14:58
you mean quietly accept that I was
15:00
betrayed and keep paying your bills
15:02
because let's be real that's what you
15:04
wanted dad stepped forward trying to
15:06
loom over me like he used to when I was
15:08
a kid Jake we raised you we fed you
15:11
clothed you gave you everything the
15:13
least you can do is help us now I looked
15:15
him dead in the eye I already did for
15:18
years and you repaid Me by cutting me
15:20
out mom's lip trembled we thought you'd
15:23
understand I exhaled shaking my head oh
15:27
I understand perfectly I understand
15:29
understand that I was never family to
15:30
you just a paycheck silence again a
15:33
suffocating undeniable silence I turned
15:36
to Eric who was still pretending to be
15:38
invisible and you what's your excuse you
15:41
had years to grow up to get your life
15:43
together to contribute but you didn't
15:46
because you knew they'd take care of you
15:47
and when they're gone you just expected
15:49
me to step in huh Eric finally snapped
15:52
what do you want me to say man I didn't
15:54
ask for this I nodded slowly right you
15:58
didn't ask you just benefited his mouth
16:01
opened then closed nothing he had
16:04
nothing mom tried one last Guilt Trip
16:06
Jake we're family family takes care of
16:09
each other I stared at her for a long
16:11
moment before answering exactly so why
16:14
didn't you take care of me she froze no
16:17
words no comeback nothing I let out a
16:20
slow breath feeling lighter than I had
16:22
in years we're done here I turned and
16:25
walked back inside closing the door
16:27
behind me before I even made it back to
16:30
my couch my phone bust a new text from
16:32
Dad wow after everything we've done for
16:35
you you're really going to abandon us I
16:37
smirked typing back no you abandoned me
16:41
I'm just finally accepting it I hit send
16:44
then I blocked their numbers but I had
16:46
no idea that blocking them was only
16:48
going to make things worse it didn't
16:50
take long for things to spiral out of
16:52
control less than a day after I blocked
16:54
them I started seeing posts on Facebook
16:57
my parents had never been the most tech
16:59
savy but they sure knew how to air their
17:01
grievances online especially when they
17:03
were feeling self-righteous at first I
17:06
thought it was just my parents being
17:07
dramatic I mean that was their go to
17:10
move airing out family drama for
17:12
everyone to see but the longer I
17:14
scrolled through their feeds the more I
17:16
realized this wasn't just about me not
17:18
helping with bills anymore the posts
17:20
were disguised as family love but they
17:22
were thinly veiled shots at me mom had
17:24
posted something about how she didn't
17:26
raise her son to be so selfish and how
17:29
true family helps each other no matter
17:30
what a few of her friends commented
17:33
along the lines of how I was a
17:34
disappointment and so out of touch with
17:36
what really matters then Dad chimed in
17:39
with his own post so-called fam should
17:42
never turn their back when you need them
17:43
most we gave everything to our children
17:46
and this is how we're repaid my son who
17:48
should be helping us in our golden years
17:50
has chosen to abandon us he tagged me
17:53
adding a passive aggressive I hope
17:55
you're happy at the end of it but the
17:57
real kicker came from Eric I should have
17:59
known he'd get in on the drama he shared
18:01
a post that was brimming with falsehoods
18:03
some people think that family is just
18:05
about money they don't understand that
18:07
family is about love and sacrifice I do
18:10
anything for my parents but some people
18:12
just don't get that they're too wrapped
18:14
up in themselves to realize that true
18:16
love is about helping those who raised
18:18
you he even threw in a disguised jab at
18:20
me I wish some people could learn what
18:22
it really means to be family I love my
18:25
parents and I'm grateful for everything
18:27
they've done that was it that was my
18:29
breaking point I sat there staring at
18:32
the screen in disbelief how had it
18:34
gotten to this point they turned this
18:36
entire situation around made me the
18:38
villain the selfish son who wasn't
18:40
willing to support his sacrificial
18:41
parents the son who didn't appreciate
18:44
all the love they gave me over the years
18:46
how could they I had always been the one
18:48
who worked hard the one who contributed
18:51
the one who never complained I had to
18:53
swallow the fact that somehow they had
18:55
convinced themselves they were in the
18:57
right and now they were telling everyone
18:59
that I was the problem I didn't want to
19:01
react immediately I took a step back
19:03
collected my thoughts and waited for a
19:05
few hours I wanted to make sure I didn't
19:08
just rush into something out of anger
19:09
but the more I thought about it the more
19:11
I realized that I couldn't let them get
19:13
away with this if they were going to
19:15
drag my name through the M I was going
19:17
to set the record straight so I pulled
19:19
out my phone and I started typing I
19:22
opened my own Facebook account the one I
19:24
kept for close friends and real family
19:26
and I posted a lengthy update I I wasn't
19:29
interested in playing their game I
19:30
didn't want to get bogged down and Petty
19:32
back and forths what I wanted to do was
19:34
tell the truth here's what I wrote I
19:37
know I've been quiet for the past couple
19:38
of days but I can't stay quiet any
19:41
longer my family has been sharing a lot
19:43
of things online about me that are
19:45
simply not true they've portrayed me as
19:47
the villain the selfish one who refuses
19:49
to help my parents in their time of need
19:51
I'm here to set the record straight I've
19:53
always helped my family from the moment
19:56
I could get a job I've been the one
19:57
helping with Bill paying for groceries
20:00
and supporting them in every way I could
20:02
but there comes a point where you can't
20:04
keep giving without being respected over
20:06
the years I've watched my parents favor
20:08
Eric giving him everything the house the
20:11
money the attention meanwhile I was
20:14
expected to just keep giving without
20:16
ever being considered as equal I'm sure
20:18
some of you might be reading this and
20:19
thinking well that's just how family
20:21
works but here's the truth family should
20:24
be a two-way street when I found out
20:26
that my parents left everything to Eric
20:28
and their will I realized how one-sided
20:30
this entire relationship had been they
20:32
didn't even consider me not even for a
20:35
moment they've made it clear that I'm
20:37
just the one they can count on when
20:38
things get rough but never the one they
20:40
actually want around unless it's
20:41
convenient for them for years I've been
20:44
the one funding their lifestyle I've
20:46
paid for vacations chipped in for bills
20:48
and even helped out with things like the
20:50
house taxes and for what to be treated
20:53
like a backup plan I'm done I'm not just
20:55
some wallet they can pull money from
20:57
whenever they need it I'm I'm a human
20:59
being and I deserve respect I've earned
21:01
the right to be treated like I'm matter
21:03
not just when they need something from
21:04
me as for Eric it's time for him to grow
21:07
up he's 28 years old and he's never
21:09
worked a day in his life he's never
21:12
taken responsibility for anything my
21:14
parents have enabled him for so long
21:16
that it's no surprise he's the one they
21:17
favor but here's the thing he's had
21:20
plenty of time to get his life together
21:22
and now it's time for him to stand on
21:24
his own two feet to everyone who has
21:26
been following this drama and supporting
21:28
my parents you need to understand that
21:30
there's always two sides to every story
21:33
yes family is important but it's also
21:35
about mutual respect I've given enough
21:37
for a lifetime and I'm not apologizing
21:40
for taking a step back this is not me
21:42
turning my back on family this is me
21:44
finally choosing myself and to my
21:46
parents I wish you the best but I am
21:49
done being your doormat I hit post and
21:51
instantly I felt a sense of relief for
21:54
the first time in my life I was telling
21:56
the world the truth about my family
21:58
about how they had taken advantage of me
22:00
for years how they had always expected
22:02
me to be the one to save them without
22:04
ever once thinking about what I needed I
22:06
wasn't going to let their narrative
22:08
control my life anymore the reactions
22:10
were instant some people who I hadn't
22:12
talked to in years came forward to
22:14
express their support a few of my
22:16
cousins friends of my parents even some
22:19
distant relatives like the post sending
22:21
me private messages telling me they were
22:23
sorry for what I had been through it
22:25
felt so freeing to finally have the
22:27
truth out there not be red under guilt
22:29
trips and manipulative Behavior but then
22:31
came the backlash my parents and Eric
22:34
went ballistic Eric messaged me you're a
22:36
traitor you really had to air all our
22:38
business out like this you have no
22:40
respect for family dad called me
22:43
practically yelling into the phone
22:44
you've ruined everything Jake you'll
22:47
regret this you'll regret cutting us off
22:50
you'll regret turning your back on your
22:51
own family but I didn't regret it not
22:54
for a second I blocked them all I was
22:56
done and for the first time time in my
22:58
life I was free free from the toxic grip
23:01
that had on me for so long as the days
23:04
passed I could feel the weight lifting
23:05
off my shoulders I was done with being
23:08
treated as less than I was done with
23:10
being the one who was always expected to
23:12
fix everyone else's problems and now I
23:15
finally had the freedom to live my own
23:16
life on my terms so no I don't feel bad
23:20
for cutting them off I deserve better I
23:22
still do and from now on I'm choosing to
23:25
surround myself with people who
23:27
appreciate me for who I am not for what
23:29
I can give them it's time for me to move
23:31
forward for good and I will let me know
